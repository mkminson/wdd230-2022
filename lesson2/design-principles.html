        <h3>Visual Hierarchy</h3>
        <p>Netflix</p>
        <a href="https://dvd.netflix.com/">Netflix.com</a>

        <p>
          Netflix's homepage exemplifies the principle of visual hierarchy by
          making it very clear what they want you to do. There are limited
          options. You can either search, sign in, or sign up. These options
          being given at the top of the page lets you know what you can do, and
          the large print saying "More to Watch" followed by smaller print
          letting you know that they add new content regularly followed by the
          big "sign up" button make it clear what you should do, and they make
          it easy to do what they want you to do, which is to sign up for their
          service.

        <h3>Rule of thirds</h3>
        <p>Intermountain Healtcare</p>
        <a href="https://intermountainhealthcare.org"
          >intermountainhealthcare.org</a
        >
        <img
          src="wk2-images/intermountainhealthcare-min.jpg"
          alt="image of intermountain healthcare's website"
        />
        <p>
          Intermountain Healthcare's homepage exemplifies the principle of the
          rule of thirds first with their first image. The woman's arm is placed
          right on the line dividing the middle and last third of the photo to
          put it right where you'll look. By doing this they ensure that when
          you visit their site you'll be sure to see that she has had a shot in
          her arm. This lets you know that they want people to get vaccinated.
          They again use the rule of thirds down below where you can see your
          options of what to do on the website. They have clearly broken the
          page up into thirds with one option on each third across the screen.
          This use of the rule of thirds makes their page clear to understand
          and easy to use.

        <h3>White space and clean design</h3>
        <p>Edge Homes</p>
        <a href="https://www.edgehomes.com/">edgehomes.com</a>
        <img
          src="wk2-images/edgehomes-min.jpg"
          alt="image of Edge homes' home page showing a clean new home"
        />
        <p>
          Edge Homes' homepage exemplifies the principle of white space and
          clean design in two ways. First, their homepage is uncluttered and
          simple. They have their logo in the upper left corner of the page, and
          plenty of literal white space between that and the page menu so you
          know that the menu is not connected to the logo. Then the space is
          filled with the image of a clean, white kitchen. While this is an
          image, and not completely white space it is another way they are
          making use of white space and clean design. It is "white space" in
          that there isn't really anything in the space except for the photo and
          there is lots of white in the photo. The photo is also of a clean
          kitchen. And if you take out the photo, the only thing left on the
          page is button to schedule a visit, and some text telling you about
          the company. This page exemplifies the principle of white space and
          clean design by using an image to make you think there is more on the
          page when really, without the image there is just a logo, menu, a
          button, and a paragraph. But the use of white space makes it a
          beautiful and functional page.
